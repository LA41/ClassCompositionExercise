# ClassCompositionExercise
This is an exercise I took to wrap my mind around OOP, and to be specific - composition :) There are four objects: Wall, Lamp, Bed and Ceiling, and they are the components of the fifth object - Bedroom. There is a couple of getters and constructors, and 2-3 methods to indicate bed being made or lamp being turned on.
